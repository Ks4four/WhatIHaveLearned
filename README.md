**Issues** when doing commission. I may add, these issues are especially for skeb clients. This list won't help you unless you want to do some reflection of your own. The final solution always is request to artists again, but I have to say good luck for the limit slots.
### Related to aspect ratio (What ratio is the best for commission artworks?)

Yes you can crop your commission artwork to different ratios. But the question is for the ratio of the final artwork artists give you.
